        This choice can either be very simple: pick the behavior with the highest weight; or it can include an element
        of stochasticity. In this latter case, the arbitrator makes a random, but biased, choice among the behaviors,
        with bias stemming from the behavior weights.

        Regardless of the selection strategy, choose action should return a tuple containing:
        1. motor recommendations (one per motob) to move the robot, and
        2. a boolean indicating whether or not the run should be halted.
